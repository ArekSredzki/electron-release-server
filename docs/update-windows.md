# Auto-updater on Windows
Electron Release Server provides a backend for the [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) auto-updater.

Refer to the [Squirrel.Windows documentation](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/tree/master/docs) on how to setup your application.

Electron Release Server will serve NuGet packages on the following endpoints:
```
http://download.myapp.com/update/win32/:version/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/win64/:version/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/win32/:version/:channel/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/win64/:version/:channel/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/flavor/:flavor/win32/:version/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/flavor/:flavor/win64/:version/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/flavor/:flavor/win32/:version/:channel/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/flavor/:flavor/win64/:version/:channel/RELEASES
```
If the channel is not specified, then `stable` will be used. If the flavor is not specified, then `default` will be used. If `win64` is used but only a `win32` asset is available, it will be used.

> Note: If desired, you can use `windows_32` instead of `win32` and `windows_64` instead of `win64`.

You'll just need to configure your `Update.exe` or `Squirrel.Windows` to use `http://download.myapp.com/update/win32/:version/:channel` as a feed URL **without query parameters.**

You'll just need to upload as release assets: `-full.nupkg` (files generated by `electron-builder` or `Squirrel.Windows` releaser).

The RELEASES file will be generated for you :)

## NSIS differential updates
Electron Release Server can also be used to serve NSIS differential updates for electron-builder.

You should define the following endpoint as url: `https://my.update.server/update/${os}/`. Electron Release Server will auto-generate the `.yml` files for the corresponding channel (`latest.yml`, `beta.yml`, `alpha.yml`). Electron-builder will fetch the `.yml` for the correct channel, check if there is a newer version and fetch the `.blockmap` file of the new release. Based on the `.blockmap` file, it will download parts of the `.exe` file. The file name of the `.blockmap` should be the same as the `.exe` file but with the extra `.blockmap` extension.
`useMultipleRangeRequest` is not supported by Electron Release Server, so it should be disabled.

To get differential updates for Windows NSIS:
1. Point electron-builder to `https://my.update.server/update/${os}/`
2. Set [`"useMultipleRangeRequest": false`](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish#genericserveroptions)
3. Upload the `.exe` and `.blockmap` files for the Windows (32-bit) build (and keep the `.blockmap` files available for all releases. Do not delete it!)
4. Electron-builder will fetch the `.yml` files (`https://my.update.server/update/win/latest.yml` or `https://my.update.server/update/win/beta.yml` or `https://my.update.server/update/win/alpha.yml`) and download the updates based on the `.blockmap`.

Keep in mind that `${os}` will result in using the Windows 32-bit uploaded files, not 64-bit. Also, the counter for the `.exe` file will be incorrect because there will be multiple requests to the `.exe` file. However, the `.blockmap` counter should be accurate because this one is downloaded onces per update.
