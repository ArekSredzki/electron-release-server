# Auto-updater on Windows
Electron Release Server provides a backend for the [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) auto-updater.

Refer to the [Squirrel.Windows documentation](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/tree/master/docs) on how to setup your application.

Electron Release Server will serve NuGet packages on the following endpoints:
```
http://download.myapp.com/update/win32/:version/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/win64/:version/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/win32/:version/:channel/RELEASES
http://download.myapp.com/update/win64/:version/:channel/RELEASES
```
If the channel is not specified, then `stable` will be used. If `win64` is used but only a `win32` asset is available, it will be used.

> Note: If desired, you can use `windows_32` instead of `win32` and `windows_64` instead of `win64`.

Your application just need to configure `Update.exe` or `Squirrel.Windows` to use `http://download.myapp.com/update/win32/:version/:channel` as a feed url (:warning: without query parameters).

You'll just need to upload as release assets: `-full.nupkg` (files generated by `electron-builder` or `Squirrel.Windows` releaser).

The RELEASES file will be generated for you :)
