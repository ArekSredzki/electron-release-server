# API
A metadata API is available to access more information about releases.

There is also a more extensive RESTful API generated by [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) for managing releases.
This private API is used by the Admin UI & is authenticated through LDAP by default, but you can customize this for your own use [without too much difficulty](deploy.md)!

> Note that since the addition of flavors, version id is formatted as `name_flavor`.

#### List versions:
```

```
