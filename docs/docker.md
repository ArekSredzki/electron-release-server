# Docker

Electron Release Server has a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml`file.
So, you can use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

## Requirements

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

## Localserver

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# open localhost:5000 in browser
```

If you use [docker-machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) you should change
`APP_URL` at `docker-compose.yml` to address to your docker-machine.

## Configurations

To run the single container provide the next environment variables:

- `APP_USERNAME`, `APP_PASSWORD` – static username and password for authentication ref.
- `DB_HOST` – hostname of postgres
- `DB_PORT` – port of postgres
- `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` – credentials to access postgres
- `DB_NAME` – Database name
- `TOKEN_SECRET` – Recommended: 63 random alpha-numeric characters
- `APP_URL` - base url for the app - [ref](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/application/sails-get-base-url)

To use `production.js` set `NODE_ENV` to `"production"` – so you should not set the environment variables:
`APP_USERNAME`, `APP_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`,
`DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `TOKEN_SECRET`.

**Warning**: You can insert the `TOKEN_SECRET`, `APP_PASSWORD`, `DB_PASSWORD` directly into the `docker-compose.yml`, but keep your secrets and private information in private. The production secrets must not be committed publicly!

## How to run

Firstly you should start with development setting to run database migration.

After it you should `always` run in production mode – set `NODE_ENV` to `"production"`.
